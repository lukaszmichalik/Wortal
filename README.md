Design of a web application available via a web browser, allowing the organization of events such as sparring games, matches or football training. The main task of the application is to facilitate communication between players, efficient selection of players for the meeting and determining the optimal place and time of the game. The website will be available to amateur football teams looking for opponents to sparring matches, as well as individual people looking for recreational training games. The key element of the application is the process of creating a sports event so that its conditions are optimal for all participants.
